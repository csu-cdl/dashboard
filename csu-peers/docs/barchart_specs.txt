Chris, Kristin,

Here are 3 of 4 files I’m going to send regarding the first things on the list that Jeff went over today (“CSU and National peers chart”). The goal is to rebuild the Page 3 bar chart in the CSU/National Peers dashboard report into an HTML5/highcharts version that we can host outside of the dashboard. Kristin – unless you tell me we can’t, I’m assuming we’ll host it on the CDL server. I’m also assuming you can create a URL for it there that Jeff can give out to the members of his GIG committee. They’ll need to be able to access this page from inside or outside of the CSU. 

Kristin, I’m asking Chris to build the page, and to confer with you on any (simple) style/header/side menus you think we need to add. By itself, it shouldn’t need a left menu, but if we decide to add another page (e.g., a new, simple, interactive version of the GIG-2025 page) then we might want to add in some simple way to jump back and forth between the two pages.   

Chris, for this page, we should have 4 drop-down menus. The first will let you select between 4th or 6th year. The second will let you select between grad rate and achievement gap. The third will let you select campus. The fourth will let you select cohort year (2000-2008 for the graduation rates, and 2004-2008 for the achievement gaps). The defaults for these menus should be: 6th Year, Graduation Rate, Bakersfield, 2008. All four of these should control the display of a single bar chart, where the selected campus is shown in one color, and the peer campuses are all shown in a second color. 

The 3 attached files are data to feed the bar chart on this page. The 4th file is the 6-year achievement gap data. I found a few download errors in that file that our student employee is going to fix for us. So that will be coming in a separate e-mail. All of this data is in the public domain, so we don’t need to protect anyone from seeing the data. (You could hard code it into the HTML script if you wanted to.) 

The sooner we can show Jeff an early version of this, the better. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Many thanks,


-Roy








Also, please add the statement/link below as a foot note under the bar chart:

Peer institutions are selected based on the methodology developed by College Results Online (for details click here).

And the URL that would go into the hyperlink should be: http://collegeresults.org/aboutthedata.aspx#section-5 

Thanks,

Roy

Chris,

Please include the content of the attached as a data table in the National Peers dashboard you’re creating. To distinguish it from the data in the actual chart, you can call this the  “CSU Campus and National Peers Descriptive Data Table”. 

Also note, (in this table, and as needed in the data behind the chart) that “ds” means “data suppressed”. In our data table, where we show “ds” we should add an asterisk (so it would be “ds*”). Then below the data table, we should add a note that reads, “*Data are suppressed where student counts (N) is less than 30.”

Thanks,

Roy

Hi Lealoa,

You are doing such a great job. I have another, related job I could use your help on. From the same website, we’d like to collect their main page from the downloaded spreadsheets. I’ve done the first two campuses in the attached (Bakersfield and Channel Islands), but I’d really appreciate your help doing the others. 

Here are some handy instructions…
1.	Go to www.collegeresults.org  
2.	In the “choose a college” text box half way down the page, type in one of our 23 campuses by name (e.g., Bakersfield) and hit enter.
3.	On the next page, in the second row of tabs, pick “similar colleges”
4.	Don’t change any of the drop down menus (they should read 2014, 6-Year, Top 15). 
5.	Click the Excel Download link.
6.	Open the downloaded spreadsheet. 
7.	Paste the 1st sheet (always called “Main”) as a new sheet in the attached spreadsheet. You can just right click on the sheet’s tab at the bottom and select “Move or Copy…” This will open a small pop-up window. In the drop-down menu select the attached spreadsheet by name (you’ll have to have this spreadsheet open already). Then in the list below, scroll to the bottom and select “(move to end)”. Then click “OK”.
8.	Rename the sheet’s tab name with the name of the campus.
9.	Repeat for the rest of the campuses.

Thank you so much!

Roy

I’ve updated the worksheet and attached it. I apologize, I’m not sure why they were zeroes initially.

Let me know if you need anything.

About those zeroes… When I go back to the website and download the data, I’m not getting zeroes. I’ve gone ahead and filled the correct numbers in for the 4-year achievement gap. Would you please go back and redo the missing 6-year gap campuses?

Thank you!

Hi Roy,

I’ve completed the 4-Year Graduation Rates as well as both the 4-Year & 6-Year Achievement Gaps.
I’ve attached all 3 worksheets.

Several universities had an achievement gap of 0%. Not sure if you needed that info, but I took note of them anyway.
The universities are:

•	Fullerton (4-Year)
•	San Jose (4-Year)
•	Chico (6-Year)
•	Long Beach (6-Year)
•	Los Angeles (6-Year)
•	San Bernardino (6-Year)
•	Sonoma (6-Year)

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
