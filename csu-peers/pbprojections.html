<h1>CSU Peer Benchmarking Chart Explanations</h1>
<h2>What data am I looking at?</h2>
<p>The historical data in these charts are downloaded from the College Results Online (CRO) website (<a href="//collegeresults.org" target="_blank">collegeresults.org</a>). They reflect 4 and 6 year graduation rates as reported by each institution to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), which is the federal government&rsquo;s annual survey of higher education institutions. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>The CSU Peers Comparison bar chart shows the selected campus and all of its CRO identified peers. 
</li>
<li>The default view for the Historical Trends chart shows the selected campus and its top four institutional peers as measured by its most recent year&rsquo;s (4-year or 6-year) graduation rate. Click items in the figure legend to show/hide individual institutions and their peers.
</li>
<li>The Projected Trends chart shows the selected campus&rsquo; historical data along with several different graduation rate projections, each using different methodologies (see the &ldquo;Projected Trends line chart&rdquo; section under &ldquo;How do I interact with this page?&rdquo; below for brief description or see the Methodology tab for detailed explanation).
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How were the peer campuses selected?</h2>
<p><a href="//www.collegeresults.org/" target="_blank">College Results Online (CRO)</a>, which is a web tool provided by the Education Trust (<a href="//edtrust.org" target="_blank">edtrust.org</a>), uses 12 variables that they have found to significantly correlate to 6-year graduation rates, in order to identify a small set of institutional peers from a data set of over 1,450 institutions. They collect their data from multiple sources including the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), other Department of Education databases; Barron&rsquo;s Profile of American Colleges; College Board; Peterson&rsquo;s Databases; and the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs. Details on their methodology can be found under the Methodology tab on this page. Further details can be found here: <a href="//collegeresults.org/aboutthedata.aspx#section-5" target="_blank">http://collegeresults.org/aboutthedata.aspx#section-5</a>.

<h2>How do I interact with this page?</h2>
<h3>CSU Peer Comparisons bar chart:</h3>
<p>At the top of the page, use the drop-down menus to choose the type of graduation rate you&rsquo;d like to see (4-year or 6-year graduation rates), the CSU campus that you want to compare to its national peers, and the entering freshmen cohort year. If, for example, you select &ldquo;6-Year Graduation Rates&rdquo; and &ldquo;2008&rdquo; as your entering freshmen cohort, this corresponds to students who started as first-time, full-time freshmen in the fall of 2008 and graduated by or before the end of summer 2014.</p>

<h3>Historical Trends line chart:</h3>
<p>At the top of the page, use the drop-down menus to choose the type of graduation rate you&rsquo;d like to see (4-year or 6-year graduation rates), the CSU campus that you want to compare to its national peers, and the timespan over which you&rsquo;d like to view the outcome trend data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Three choices are offered for timespan selections &ldquo;Since 2000&rdquo;, shows graduation rates for freshmen entering the selected CSU campus as far back as the year 2000. The other time span options, &ldquo;Past Five Years&rdquo; and &ldquo;Past Three Years&rdquo;, shows graduation rates for freshmen entering in the most recent 5 years (or 3 years) for which we have data. 
</li>
<li>Note that the years shown in the x-axis reflect the year that the students entered as freshmen.  If, for example, you select &ldquo;6-Year Graduation Rates&rdquo; the data points for the year 2008 are for students who began as first-time, full-time freshmen in the fall of 2008 and graduated by or before the end of summer 2014.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the figure legend, click on any campus to hide or show its trend line in the chart above.</p>

<h3>Projected Trends line chart:</h3>
<p>At the top of the page, use the drop-down menus to choose the type of graduation rate (4-year or 6-year graduation rates), the CSU campus, and the Projection methodology that you want to view. You can choose between two basic methodologies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jodie&rsquo;s Methodology</strong> shows three projections.  Each approach begins with the average 2008 graduation rate and the average rate of change over the past five years for the selected campus' top five peers. (The &ldquo;top five peers&rdquo; may include the campus itself if it is among the top five performing institutions within its peer group.) The middle projection uses these values to create a linear projection of graduation rates through 2025. The upper projection adds the standard deviation of the top five peers&rsquo; rate of change over the past five years to this projection. The lower projection subtracts the standard deviation of the top five peers&rsquo; rate of change to this projection.</li>

<li>The <strong>Linear Model</strong> employs a linear optimization methodology to set campus goals that sum up to meet the systemwide graduation rate targets, while simultaneously closing each campuses&rsquo; URM and Pell eligible achievement gaps. Two systemwide graduation goals were used for the 4-year graduation rate (35% and 40%), and two system-wide goals were used for the 6-year graduation rate (65% and 70%).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the figure legend, click on any campus to hide or show its trend line in the chart above.</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The years shown in the x-axis reflect the year that students entered as freshmen. If, for example, you select &ldquo;6-Year Graduation Rates&rdquo; the data points for the year 2008 are for students who began as first-time, full-time freshmen in the fall of 2008 and graduated by or before the end of summer 2014.</li>
<li>The latest publicly available four-year graduation rate data for peer institutions is shown for the 2008 cohort graduating in 2012.  For CSU campuses, more current data is available, including the 2009, 2010, and 2011 cohorts.</li>

<h1>CSU Peer Benchmarking Methodology</h1>
<h2>Identifying Peer Campuses</h2>
<img src="assets/logo_cro.jpg" style="float:right;margin:5px 10px 8px 22px;"/>
<p>The national peer institutions selected for this dashboard come from College Results Online (CRO). CRO applies an algorithm comparing the chosen school to all other public and private not-for-profit institutions in the CRO database. Each comparison receives a "similarity score", ranging from 0 (least similar) to 1000 (identical), based on how similar the two schools are in terms of 12 institutional and student characteristics. The 12 selected characteristics are statistically correlated with overall six-year graduation rates for institutions in the public and private not-for-profit sectors (see Table 1). Once the baseline similarity score is calculated, CRO applies additional "filters" to exclude an institution from possible comparison if it greatly deviates from the chosen institution on any one of a number of factors 
(<a href="http://collegeresults.org/aboutthedata.aspx#section-5" target="_blank">see CRO Website</a> for list of filters).  This prevents, for example, an institution with 2,500 undergraduates from being compared to an institution with 25,000 undergraduates, even if they are otherwise very similar.</p>

<h2>Average Annual Change</h2>
<p>The average annual improvement rates reported in the table to the right of the Historical Trends line chart, were calculated using the formula below:</p>
<p class="formula"><span class="numerator">G<sub>2</sub> &#8212; G<sub>1</sub></span><span class="division_line">&#9135;&#9135;&#9135;&#9135;&#9135;&#9135;&#9135;</span><span class="denominator">Y<sub>2</sub> &#8212; Y<sub>1</sub> </span></p>
<p>where <em>G</em><sub>2</sub> is the most recent year's graduation rate, <em>G</em><sub>1</sub> is the graduation rate of the earliest year in the selected time frame, <em>Y</em><sub>2</sub> is the most recent year, and <em>Y</em><sub>1</sub> is the earliest year in the selected time frame.</p>

<h2>Projected Trends</h2>
<p>Two methodologies are presented for projecting graduation rates for CSU campuses: "Jodie's Methodology" and "Linear Model". </p>

<h3>Jodie's Methodology</h3>
<p>This methodology calculates a central projection along with related upper and lower bounds. The central projection is generated by first calculating the average 2008 graduation rate for the selected campus' top five peers. This value is presented as the 2008 value for the three "Jodie's Methodology" projections. (Note that the "top five peers" can include the campus itself if it is among the top five performing institutions among its CRO peers.) For the central projection, subsequent values incrementally increase (or decrease) the 2008 value by cumulatively adding the average rate of change observed over the past 5 years for the top five peer institutions. Upper and lower projections are also based on the 2008 average graduation rate for the top five peers. These values are incremented by cumulatively adding the average rate of change observed over the past 5 years for the top five peer institutions plus the standard deviation of this average change (for the upper bound) or minus the standard deviation of this average change (for the lower bound).</p>

<h3>Linear Model (Linear Programming Model)</h3>
<p>The linear programming (or linear optimization model) generates potential campus graduation rate targets by working backwards from specific pre-determined constraints. This includes specific System-wide graduation rate targets (35% or 40% for 4-year graduation rate goals, and 65% or 70% for 6-year graduation rate goals), as well as closing URM and Pell achievement gaps at every campus. It provides an alternate approach for goal-setting compared to trend and/or benchmarking approaches. 
Campus graduation rates are broken down by Pell and URM status, resulting in 92 different graduation rate groups that comprise the whole System (23 campuses X URM/Non-URM groups X Pell Eligible/Non-Eligible groups).</p>

<p>Campus rates are derived based on optimizing an objective function by varying graduation rates across the groups that minimizes the variance in the percentage point change in graduation rates across all groups. Using this as the objective, all groups should improve by similar rates. This will necessarily diverge with the additional constraints of meeting all of the Graduation Initiative objectives, including closing achievement gaps. Rates are based on the latest cohort for which final Pell grant awards are available, which corresponds to the Fall 2014 cohort.</p>

<p>Models were run for target rates (4-year/6-year first-time, full-time freshmen), using the following System targets. </p>

<table id="model_methods"  class="table table-striped"><thead>
<th>Goal</th>
<th>Cohort Group</th>
<th>Current Rate</th>
<th>System Target 1</th>
<th>System Target 2</th>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>4-Year Graduation Rate Goal (2021 Cohort)</td>
<td>First-time, Full-Time Freshmen</td>
<td>19.1%</td>
<td>35.0%</td>
<td>40.0%</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>6-Year Graduation Rate Goal (2019 Cohort)</td>
<td>First-time, Full-Time Freshmen</td>
<td>57.0%</td>
<td>65.0%</td>
<td>75.0%</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The model assumes a target System-wide graduation rate along with some other constraints. The individual rate for any subgroup (by campus/Pell/URM must be greater than or equal to the most recent available rate (2009 cohort for 6 year and 2011 cohort for 4 year). Additional constraints are imposed within the models that bounds the percentage point change for any single campus. Targets 1 and 2 use an upper bound of a 20 percentage point increase for campus 4yr rates. Target 3 uses a 25 percentage point upper bound and 10 percentage point lower bound for growth for each campus. The models also enforce a Pell and URM achievement gap that is less than or equal to zero.</p>
